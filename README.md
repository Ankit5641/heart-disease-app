# heart-disease-app
This is a mini machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on medical parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.
It is built using:

🧠 Random Forest Classifier for prediction

📊 Streamlit for interactive web app

🧮 Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data processing and model building

🔍 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to predict heart disease in patients using a machine learning model trained on the popular UCI Heart Disease Dataset.

Users can input their medical details via a simple web interface and get an instant prediction — whether they are at risk of heart disease or not.

🧠 Features
✅ User-friendly Streamlit Web App

✅ Real-time prediction from trained ML model

✅ Uses Random Forest for accurate results

✅ Scaled inputs using StandardScaler

✅ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy access
